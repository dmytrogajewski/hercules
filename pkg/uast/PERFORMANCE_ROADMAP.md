# UAST Performance Optimization Roadmap

## Performance Analysis Summary (2024-07-10)

Based on comprehensive benchmarking, the UAST package shows excellent performance for small and medium files, but significant optimization opportunities for very large files and specific operations.

---

## Recent Progress (2024-07-11)

**Phase 1: Object Pooling & Memory Optimization**

- Implemented `sync.Pool` for `Node` structs in `node.go`.
- All node allocations in hot paths now use the pool, with proper cleanup and lifecycle management.
- **Phase 1.2 Complete**: Implemented comprehensive memory allocation optimizations:
  - Added slice pre-allocation for known sizes in TreeSitter provider and DSL parser
  - Optimized result slice allocations in all DSL query functions (map, filter, rmap, rfilter)
  - Added tree size estimation functions for better capacity planning
  - Pre-allocated children slices with reasonable capacity (4) in node creation
  - Optimized findNodesWithPredicate with estimated result sizes
- Benchmarks were updated and show a 3.8% average time improvement and a significant reduction in allocations for large and very large files, with no regressions for small/medium files.
- The new `make compare-last` command allows easy comparison of the latest benchmark runs.

### Current Performance Characteristics:
- **Small files (~50 lines)**: ~32μs parsing, excellent performance
- **Medium files (~100 lines)**: ~270μs parsing, good performance  
- **Large files (~200 lines)**: ~1ms parsing, acceptable performance
- **Very large files (~2000 lines)**: ~10ms parsing, **needs optimization**

### Critical Performance Issues Identified:
1. **Very large file parsing**: 10x slower than expected linear scaling
2. **Very large file DSL queries**: 5.6x slower for 10x larger files
3. **Change detection on very large files**: 18x slower for 40x larger files
4. **Memory allocation patterns**: High allocation overhead for large files
