# Functional Requirements Documents (FRD) for UAST Package

This directory contains Functional Requirements Documents (FRDs) that define the specifications for features and components in the UAST (Unified Abstract Syntax Tree) package. Each FRD provides a clear, detailed specification for implementing a specific feature or component.

## Overview

FRDs serve as the authoritative specification for feature development in the UAST package. They ensure consistency, clarity, and completeness in feature requirements across the development team.

## FRD Structure and Requirements

### Required Sections

Every FRD must include the following sections:

#### 1. **Overview**
- Brief description of the feature/component
- High-level purpose and context within the UAST system
- Clear statement of what the feature accomplishes

#### 2. **Goals**
- Specific, measurable objectives for the feature
- Success criteria that can be validated
- Alignment with overall UAST package objectives

#### 3. **Requirements**

##### Functional Requirements
- Detailed specification of what the feature must do
- API signatures, interfaces, and data structures
- Expected behavior for all inputs and edge cases
- Integration points with existing components

##### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance requirements (e.g., time complexity, memory usage)
- Concurrency and thread safety requirements
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Backward compatibility requirements

#### 4. **API Requirements** (if applicable)
- Complete function signatures with parameter types
- Return value specifications
- Error handling patterns
- Usage examples and patterns

#### 5. **Implementation Requirements**
- Technical constraints and design decisions
- Dependencies on other components or external libraries
- Required algorithms or data structures
- Code organization and package structure

#### 6. **Testing Requirements**
- Unit test coverage expectations
- Integration test scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions to test
- Performance benchmarks (if applicable)
- Golden tests for complex outputs

#### 7. **Documentation Requirements**
- GoDoc comments for all public APIs
- Usage examples and tutorials
- Integration guides
- API reference documentation

#### 8. **Out of Scope**
- Explicitly state what is NOT included in this feature
- Future work that may be related but not part of this implementation
- Dependencies that are handled elsewhere

#### 9. **Acceptance Criteria**
- Specific, testable criteria for feature completion
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
- Quality gates and validation requirements
- Integration test requirements

### Optional Sections

#### **Technical Design** (for complex features)
- Detailed design decisions and rationale
- Architecture diagrams or pseudocode
- Data flow descriptions
- Integration patterns

#### **Implementation Plan** (for large features)
- Phased approach or milestones
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Timeline estimates

#### **Success Metrics**
- Quantitative measures of success
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality indicators
- User experience metrics

## FRD Naming Convention

- Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
- Format: `feature_name.md` or `component_name.md`
- Examples: `uast_converter.md`, `language_mapping.md`, `token_extraction.md`

## FRD Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Be specific and avoid ambiguity
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include concrete examples where helpful

### Code Examples
- Provide complete, runnable code examples
- Use idiomatic Go code that follows project conventions
- Include error handling in examples
- Show both simple and complex usage patterns

### API Specifications
- Include complete function signatures
- Specify parameter types and constraints
- Document return values and error conditions
- Provide usage examples for each public API

### Testing Specifications
- Define specific test scenarios
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Specify performance requirements
- Require comprehensive test coverage

## Review and Approval Process

### Before Implementation
1. **Technical Review**: Review by senior developers for technical feasibility
2. **Architecture Review**: Ensure alignment with overall system architecture
3. **Cross-team Review**: Review by affected teams and stakeholders
4. **Final Approval**: Approval by project maintainers

### During Implementation
1. **Progress Updates**: Regular updates on implementation progress
2. **Design Changes**: Document any deviations from the FRD
3. **Issue Resolution**: Address any issues discovered during implementation

### After Implementation
1. **Validation**: Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect final implementation
3. **Lessons Learned**: Document any insights for future FRDs
